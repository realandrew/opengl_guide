# Introduction

Welcome! OpenGL Guide is an [open source](https://github.com/realandrew/opengl_guide) website that attempts to teach the OpenGL graphics API (using the Rust language) and related real-time graphics topics.

This site is currently a placeholder. I plan to start working on in the next few years, but currently my effort is being put into my [Vulkan Guide](https://vulkanguide.com/).

For now, I would highly recommend Joey de Vries great OpenGL tutorials at [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).
